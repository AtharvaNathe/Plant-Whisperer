## 📌 Overview  
**Plant Whisperer** is a Django-based web application that helps users check the health of their plants using:  
- **Form Inputs** (sunlight, watering frequency, leaf color, pest presence, etc.)  
- **Image Uploads** (basic simulated analysis using Pillow; extendable to CNN-based deep learning models)  

The app predicts whether a plant is **Thriving 🌱, Okay 🌤️, Weak 🌿, or Sick 🤒**, generates a **health score**, and provides **actionable care recommendations**.
