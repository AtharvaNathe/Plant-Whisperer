    This function simulates image analysis. In a real project, you would
    load a deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch) here
    to classify the plant's health from the image.

    For demonstration:
    - It opens the image using Pillow.
    - It checks the image dimensions or filename to simulate a prediction.
    - Returns a label, score, and advice based on the simulated analysis.
